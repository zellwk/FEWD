// Write a game of scissors paper stone.
//
// Requirements:
// 1. Player 1 needs to be able to choose either scissors, paper or stone
// 2. Player 2 needs to be able to choose either scissors, paper or stone
// 3. When both players have chosen, figure out who wins
// 4. Show the winner
// 5. Show the "another game?" button
// 6. When "another game?" button is clicked, game resets back to its original state
//
// Extra points:
// 1. Each player's choice is highlighted so you know from a glance who chose what. You may need to add a class for this.

// Hints for this exercise
// 1. Both player 1 and player 2 answers should be created with a `let` declaration
// 2. You need to listen for a `click` event on all six possible choices. You may need to add classes to the HTML for this.
// 3. When a choice is clicked, check whether player 1 and player 2 variables contain answers
// 4. Determine winner if both player1 and player 2 have chosen their answers
// 5. Show winner and repeat game button. You may need to remove classes you've added and also reset player1 and player 2 answers
